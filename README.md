<!-- Expanding Cards

This is a simple web project that demonstrates a responsive card layout where cards expand and collapse when clicked. Each card features an image and a descriptive text that becomes visible when the card is expanded. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features

Interactive Panels: Clickable cards that expand smoothly.
Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes, with cards becoming vertical on smaller screens.
Text Animations: Text fades in when a card is expanded.
Background Images: Each card features a unique background image from Unsplash.
Media Queries: Specific adjustments for mobile screens (max-width 768px and 480px).
Tech Stack

HTML: Structure of the web page.
CSS: Styling and layout.
JavaScript: Handles the interaction logic.
How It Works

When the page loads, one card is expanded by default. You can click on any card to expand it, which will collapse the previously active card. The transitions between the active and inactive states are smooth, providing a visually appealing experience.

Project Structure

HTML: Creates the basic layout with a container and five panel div elements. The active panel will initially be set via the class active.
CSS: Responsible for the styling and responsiveness of the cards. It also controls the smooth transitions for expanding and collapsing cards.
JavaScript: Adds the interactive behavior. When a card is clicked, the JavaScript code removes the active class from all panels and adds it to the clicked panel.
